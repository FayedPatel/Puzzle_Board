# Puzzle_Board

This project was something I made solving a board of 4x4.
This project uses mem allocation and implementation of algorithms such as 
  * DFS
  * BFS
  
 to calculate Manhattan distance

There will be a prompt asking for 16 numbers.
Simply enter the numbers  and make sure no duplicates.
